In the heart of Colombo, The Outer Clove's story unfolds with its visionary founder, Ashane Lakshitha, who planted the seeds of this culinary haven in 2018.
                                       
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                            Fueled by a passion for gastronomy and a dream to redefine dining experiences, Ashane embarked on a journey to create a place where flavors dance and traditions come alive. 
           
                            </p><br>
                            <p>
                            Inspired by the rich culinary tapestry of Colombo, The Outer Clove emerged as a testament to Ashane's dedication, bringing a unique blend of creativity and authenticity to the city's vibrant dining scene.

                            <p>
                            Today, The Outer Clove stands as a living testament to Ashane's visionâ€”a place where every dish whispers the story of its inception.
